![Cases vs Deaths Over Time](https://github.com/mwemaphil/Covid-19/assets/45120853/d8f0a922-2389-400e-aa1b-e201b2ca1670)
On 5th May 2023, World Health Organization and Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, Director general of WHO declared the end of the Covid-19 Public Health Emergency, although noting that it still remains a global health threat. After more than 3 years after being declared a Pandemic on 11th March 2020, we take a look at the numbers in terms of cases confirmed, deaths reported and vaccination over time globally using data provided from WHO's data page. 

Analysis and visualization were done and compiled using Tableau.

As of 5th May 2023, 765,222.932 cases had been confirmed globally, with 6,921,641 having succumbed over time since the first case was reported. This represents just under 1% of the mortality rate of 0.9045%. Over 13 billion doses have been administered from a variety of 1,115 types of vaccines used globally. From this, over 5.5 billion people have been fully vaccinated as of 5th May 2023 when Covid-19 ceased being a health emergency as announced by WHO.

Europe leads with the number of confirmed cases over time, followed by the Western Pacific which includes China, Australia, and Japan among others. Africa has a record of few cases confirmed over time compared to other regions.

### Global Cases over time
![Cases over time](https://github.com/mwemaphil/Covid-19/assets/45120853/a6382f18-74f7-4d0b-ba80-7cd458ebc078)
Confirmed cases have been increasing gradually with specific spikes mostly due to the emergence of more contagious Variants like Omicron, Delta, Alpha, and more. After the greatest spike in cases confirmed in December 2022, mainly from a surge of cases confirmed from China which also led to a partial lockdown of China (again) there has been a decline in the number of cases confirmed leading to the ending of the emergency health position of the Covid-19.

Around late December China reported a surge in covid-19 cases with up to a high of 6.9 million cases in a single day on 22 December 2022 leading to the intervention of WHO and China Leadership. This explains the highest spike of cases as seen in the above visualizations.


![Deaths over time](https://github.com/mwemaphil/Covid-19/assets/45120853/d3c8e787-2cf7-47e4-8d52-053f3a461729)
With a low mortality rate of 0.9045%, they have been low deaths compared to confirmed cases. The figure represents the deaths over time which have reduced gradually since 2021 up to the end of the announcement of the health emergency in May 2023. The mortality rate has also greatly reduced since the onset of the pandemic up until May 2023.
